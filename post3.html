        <h1>🌐 Understanding the Internet</h1>

        <p>
            The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate 
            with each other to share information, resources, and services. It allows people and machines 
            to exchange data instantly—whether it’s sending emails, browsing websites, streaming videos, 
            or playing online games.

        <h2>📜 Brief History of the Internet</h2>

        <p>
            The internet began in the 1960s as <strong>ARPANET</strong>, a U.S. military project designed 
            to create a communication system capable of surviving a nuclear attack. In 1969, the first 
            message was sent between two computers, marking the beginning of modern networking.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the 1970s, <strong>TCP/IP</strong> was introduced—forming the basic rules for data 
            transmission. The first email was also sent in 1971.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the 1980s, the network expanded beyond the military, and the <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> 
            was created, making websites easier to access.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 1990s saw a revolution with the invention of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> by 
            Tim Berners-Lee, and the Mosaic browser, which brought the internet to the public. 
            Search engines and e-commerce also emerged.
        </p>

        <p>
            From 2000 onward, the rise of social media, cloud computing, and mobile internet transformed 
            digital communication. In the 2010s, IoT became widespread.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, the internet continues to evolve with <strong>AI, Web3, and quantum computing</strong>, 
            shaping the future of global connectivity.
